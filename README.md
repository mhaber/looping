# (Senior) Data Scientist NLP Task

Part of our data science work at Looping consists of gaining a better understanding of our brands' audiences, their interests, their preferences, and their needs. We generate our insights primarely from user generated content found on social media and online forums.

**The Data**

[mb.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaber/looping/master/mb.csv) contains 39k tweets published between January 14 and May 27 2019 with hashtags referring to Mercedes-Benz. The data have not been cleaned but are relatively well-structured. Your key variables will probably be "username", "tweet" and "hashtags".

**The Task**

Feel free to explore the data set and analyze the information in which ever way you think is best to generate insights about:

- the topics that users associate with Mercedes-Benz (general topics and Mercedes-Benz specific products)
- things users like/hate about the brand and its products
- the types of users, i.e. current customers of Mercedes-Benz who own a Mercedes product, prospective customers interested in buying a Mercedes and churners who have abandoned Mercedes-Benz or are about to

**Submission**

Please try to submit your results (preferably in form of a notebook document) by August 25 via email to <a href="mailto:mh@looping.group">mh@looping.group</a>
